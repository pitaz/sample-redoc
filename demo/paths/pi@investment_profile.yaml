    The investment profile contains a set of questions to be filled by the user before they can make their first deposit. We require this information to create a brokerage account for the user to trade with. These questions are about the user's risk tolerance, liquidity, experience etc.
    You can get all the questions and acceptable values for the fields using the dictionary endpoint.
